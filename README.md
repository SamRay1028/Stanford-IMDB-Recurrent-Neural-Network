# Stanford-IMDB-Recurrent-Neural-Network

Description: This is a project that contains the final iteration of a recurrent neural network programmed from scratch and trained on the Stanford large movie review dataset, a dataset that consists of 50,000 movie reviews that either express positive or negative sentiments. The network is trained to identify whether the text from a review expresses either positive or negative sentiment. Root Mean Squared propogation is used to optimize training. Currently, maximum accuracy achieved is around 80%.
